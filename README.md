# Laser-Morse
Transmission of messages using the KY008 laser module and a photoresistor using arduino
The idea of this project is to implement the transmission of text messages by laser method through an open atmospheric route. The project consists of a transmitter that sends pulses of a given length using a laser and a receiver that captures this pulse using a photodiode, a solar panel or a resistor. The sensitivity to radiation is adjusted using a potentiometer. The heart of the receiver and transmitter is Arduino microcontrollers
